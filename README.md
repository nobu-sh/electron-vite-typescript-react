# Electron Vite Typescript React Boilerplate

I recently decided to start tinkering around with
ElectronJS. After alot of searching around, I could
not find a boilerplate that suited my needs and was
not outdated.

So after some messing around I made this boilerplate.
It is extremely fast thanks to Vite and supports
hot reload thanks to Vite.

## Usage

### Dev

When developing you need to start Vite server first,
then electron dev server.

```sh
$ npm run dev:vite
```
```sh
$ npm run dev:electron
```
